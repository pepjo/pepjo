👋 I’m Pep Rodeja, an **aerospace engineer who codes**. I live in the UK but grew up in
Catalonia.

I've **worked at Open Cosmos** 🛰️ since completing my studies in Aerospace Engineering in
Barcelona and Cranfiend. I started as an intern and got promoted several times
until reaching **Ground Segment Technical Lead** 📡. I currently manage the software team
that delivers on our mission desing, mission control, and data distribution products.

Some of my **interests derive from my fascination for complex and well-engineered systems** 🚉.
At work, I love -trying to- architect reliable and observable microservices solutions
on Kubernetes. And beyond software, I am interested in cities and their transport systems,
and irrationably excited about in walkability and public transit.

While -so far- I've mostly remained in the high-level software world, I **would love to
learn more about electronics and low-level microcontrollers**. So far, I've only dabbled
into it through two of **my hobbies: maintaining my smarthome and freestyle FPV drones**.

You may want to read more about me on my website [pep.rodeja.me](https://pep.rodeja.me).
Hopefully, one day, I will also publish some new blog posts about random interesting topics.
