Iâ€™m Pep Rodeja, an aerospace engineer who codes. I live in the UK but grew up in
Catalonia.

I studied Aerospace Engineering in Barcelona and Cranfiend, UK and have worked at
Open Cosmos since then. There, I started as an intern and got promoted several times
until today, where I am the Ground Segment Technical Lead, managing the software team
that delivers on our mission desin, mission control, and data distribution products.

I feel compeled by complex optimised systems which makes me love working with Kubernetes
and architecting reliable and observable microservices solutions. Beyond software,
I am fascinated by cities and their transport systems, I am specially interested in
walkability and public transit.

While, so far, I've mostly remained in the high level software world, I would love to
learn more about electronics and low level microcontrollers. So far, I've only dabed
into it through two of my hobbies: maintaining my smarthome and freestyle FPV drones.

You might read more about me on my website pep.rodeja.me, and maybe someday you will
also be able to find some new blog posts about random topics.
